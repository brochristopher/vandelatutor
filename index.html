        <p>Hello, my name is Vandela and I am excited you are here. I am currently a college student with aspirations to be a mathematics professor. I have an Associate Degree in General Studies and will receive an Associate Degree in Mathematics in May 2019. I have a rambunctious three year old that keeps me on my toes, but I love watching her grow and learn.</p>
